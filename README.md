# Introduction

This repository contains notes from my journey into learning Data Science and Machine Learning. Resources here come from several sources, mainly: the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), by Jose Portilla; the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book by Hadley Wickham and the [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/) book by Gareth James _et al._.

Because of the many sources and the fact that I began writing these notes following Portilla's Udemy course, some of the material and examples will be in Python, but, due to my recent shift in focus to learning R, newer material will be in R (although I might still do some things with Python as well).

The notes in this repository were created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [obsidian-dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), so I recommend you get both to get the most out of these notes.
